4. A's are high
5. The suit spacdes are the highest ranked suit. The other suits are all equal in value. 
7. Once each player is dealt their hand each hand player has to guess how many times he or she will win in the current round.Your guess is between 0 and not number of cards you have at the begining of the round
8. The dealer plays the first card. What ever the suit is the next player must play the same suit ( if they have it ). If they do not have the same suit they can play any card they choose. In order to win the round you need to have the highest card values that is the same suit as the first card unless they play a spade. The spade suit is rated higher than any other. If a spade is played it the highest spade that wins
9. One player starts off as the dealer. The dealer gets to go frist. Who ever wins after that gets to go first.
